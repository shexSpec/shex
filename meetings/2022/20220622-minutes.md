## Community Updates
* ericP: Labra and I discussed shexDecls on shapes in ShExJ. In favor if issue #50
https://github.com/shexSpec/spec/issues/50
Looked at having annotation on node constraints with Andra. Also looked at value set values, verified it was possible. It makes sense to make this change at the same time change issue 50.
* Iovka: Can you repeat shapeDecls discussion?
* ericP: shapeDecls allows us to add additional labels for nested shapes
* Iovka: Will shapeDecls replace labels everywhere?
* ericP: yes
* Andra: I'm working on schemas for 3 disease domains. Participants want to see visualizations. I looked at shapeForms. These forms align with the forms from the data providers. But with value sets, we need to extend the annotations to work for value sets. 
* ericP: Asked some people using shexjs for feedback on us breaking things- they said that it would be fine, can use typescript to quickly repair.
* Iovka: Finished implementation of EXTENDS.
* Andra: How to manage the phase when collaborators are intimidated by schema reading.
* ericP: Does the intelliJ plug in help with that at all?
* Andra: Plugin helps when you want to write schemas and you already know ShEx.
* Seyed: Data Quality Days- Seyed will use 10-15 to present about references
* Iovka:
