# Minutes ShExCG 2022-11-09

Participants:
- Andra, Kat, Jose, Tom


## Updates
* Jose: Jose is at the biohackathon and is making progress on extracting subsets from wikidata using shape expressions. 
* Kat: no updates
* Tom: Some members of this group are part of a new project using shape expressions
* Andra: Virtually participating in biohackathon. Writing a crude shape expression that gets things like look like genes - where much curation needs to happen. Inclined to pull out of Wikidata and process there. Load into GraphDB with OntoText. Gene example is too big to handle in XXX or in Jena. GraphDB uses file system loading, while the others use the Web browser. GraphDB is for running complex SPARQL queries that would time out on Wikidata.

## Minutes

* Jose suggests to take inspiration by the [PDF association](https://www.pdfa.org/) and [this podcast](https://www.se-radio.net/2022/10/episode-532-peter-wyatt-and-duff-johnson-on-30-years-of-pdf/). They became a standard 3 decades ago, but the interesting part is that they also created an international association. 
* Jose reports from the BioHackathon, where they are using ShEx for subsetting Wikidata.
* Jose was working on the extends...it is almost ready, only 3 remaining examples fail... Important for ShEx to keep evolving.
