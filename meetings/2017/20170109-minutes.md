# ShEx Meeting 2017-01-09

- venue: https://meet.jit.si/shex
- chair: Dimitris
- scribe: ericP
- present: Dimitris, ericP, Jose

## Scratch

This area is for shared scratch.
We enter ideas and proposals at the top.
When moving on to a new topic, we give the shared scratch area a title with "###"s before it and push it down.
The object of this is that active discussion always occurs at the top of the document and minutes go at the bottom.
(That's hard on the scribe who will wear out his/her home and end keys but we don't have a better idea at present.)

### Writing URLs

Since we're using github markdown, urls are entered with []s with link text followed by ()s around the URL.

## MINUTES
